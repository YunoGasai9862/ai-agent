Several European countries offer tuition-free or low-cost master’s programs, particularly at public universities. Germany: Public universities generally charge no tuition fees for both EU and non-EU students; semester contributions (~€150–€350) cover administrative costs and public transport. Popular institutions include Technical University of Munich and University of Heidelberg. Norway: All public institutions (e.g., University of Oslo, University of Bergen) are tuition-free for international students, though living expenses (~€12,000/year) are substantial. Finland: EU/EEA students study for free; non-EU/EEA students pay tuition fees (often €10,000–€20,000/year) but many universities offer scholarships (e.g., University of Helsinki). Sweden: Tuition abolished for EU/EEA; non-EU/EEA fees apply, but scholarships available (e.g., Lund University Global Scholarships). Austria: EU/EEA students pay minimal fees (~€726/semester); non-EU/EEA fees are low (~€1,500/year). Other opportunities include Czech Republic (free in Czech-taught programs), France (state-set master’s fees ~€200/year), and Italy (fees ~€1,000–€2,000/year).
